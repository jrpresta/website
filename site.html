        The purpose of this website is to allow a user to upload an image and have it
        recognized. As of right now, the model that I have distinguishes between
        apples and oranges. I hope to learn how to deploy that model on the server at
        the back-end, and I want the front-end HTML to be decent.

    <form action="/action_page.php">
        <input type="file" name="pic" accept="image/*">
        <input type="submit">
    </form>
</body>
