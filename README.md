# Movie Review Website

This repository creates and "deploys" an attention model for the classification of the [IMDB movie review dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). The architecture for the attention model is based on [this paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/papers/16HLT-hierarchical-attention-networks.pdf). The data cleaning and pre-processing takes place in the Jupyter notebook along with the training of the model.

In order to launch the website, execute the python file app_dir/run_app.py.
