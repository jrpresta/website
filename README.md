# Movie Review Website

This repository creates and "deploys" an attention model for the classification of the [IMDB movie review dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). The architecture for the attention model is based on [this paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/papers/16HLT-hierarchical-attention-networks.pdf). The data cleaning and pre-processing  has been done in Jupyter Notebook also training of models too.
